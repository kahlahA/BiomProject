                    <p>
                        The Arctic biome is one of the most unique and extreme ecosystems on Earth, characterized 
                        by its frigid temperatures, icy landscapes, and specialized wildlife. Located at the 
                        northernmost regions of the planet, the Arctic biome encompasses the Arctic Ocean and parts 
                        of Alaska, Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Scandinavia. This biome is defined by its cold 
                        climate, with long winters and short, cool summers. The temperature can drop as low as 
                        -40°F (-40°C) in winter and reach just above freezing during summer months. Despite these 
                        harsh conditions, the Arctic is home to a remarkable variety of life forms that have adapted 
                        to survive in such an unforgiving environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary characteristic of the Arctic biome is its lack of vegetation. The growing 
                        season is brief, and the soil is often frozen, known as permafrost, which makes it difficult 
                        for many plants to thrive. However, hardy species like mosses, lichens, and low-growing shrubs 
                        can survive in the short summer period, when the ground briefly thaws. The sparse plant life supports 
                        a variety of herbivores, such as Arctic hares, caribou, and lemmings, which in turn provide food for 
                        carnivores like Arctic foxes, wolves, and polar bears.
