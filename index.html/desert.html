                <h1>The Desert</h1>
                <p>
                    The desert biome, covering about one-fifth of Earth’s surface, 
                    is defined by its extremely dry conditions, with an annual rainfall 
                    of no more than 50 centimeters (20 inches). The landscape of deserts 
                    can vary significantly, with soil that may be sandy, gravelly, or 
                    stony, depending on the type of desert. There are four main types of 
                    deserts: hot and dry, semi-arid, coastal, and cold. Hot and dry deserts, 
                    like the Sahara and Mojave, experience high temperatures year-round, while 
                    semi-arid deserts, found in places like North America and Asia, have cooler
                    winters with occasional rainfall. Coastal deserts, such as the Atacama Desert 
                    in Chile, are more humid but still receive little rain. Cold deserts, like 
                    Antarctica, are dry but have frigid temperatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The harsh desert environment is home to a variety of animals that have adapted 
                    to survive extreme conditions. Invertebrates such as scorpions, tarantulas, and 
                    desert beetles are common, while mammals like the fennec fox and kangaroo rat 
                    have developed strategies to conserve water and stay cool. Birds such as the 
                    roadrunner and burrowing owl are adept at finding food and shelter in the arid 
                    landscape. Reptiles, including the Gila monster and horned lizard, thrive in the 
                    heat by regulating their body temperature and seeking shade when needed. Amphibians 
                    like the desert rain frog and spadefoot toad emerge only when conditions are moist, 
                    and fish such as the desert pupfish inhabit isolated water sources. These adaptations 
                    enable a wide variety of species to survive and even flourish in one of Earth’s most 
                    challenging biomes.
