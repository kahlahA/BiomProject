        <h1>Climate</h1>
        <p>
            The desert biome is defined by its extremely dry conditions with an annual rainfall of no more than 50 centimeters (20 inches). The landscape of deserts can vary significantly, with soil that may be sandy, gravelly, or stony, depending on the type of desert. There are four main types of deserts: hot and dry, semi-arid, coastal, and cold. Hot and dry deserts, like the Sahara and Mojave, experience high temperatures year-round, while semi-arid deserts, found in places like North America and Asia, have cooler winters with occasional rainfall. Coastal deserts, such as the Atacama Desert in Chile, are more humid but still receive little rain. Cold deserts, like Antarctica, are dry but have frigid temperatures.
        </p>
        <h1>Animal Life</h1>
        <p>
            The harsh desert environment is home to a variety of animals that have adapted to survive extreme conditions. Invertebrates such as scorpions, tarantulas, and desert beetles are common, while mammals like the fennec fox and kangaroo rat have developed strategies to conserve water and stay cool. Birds such as the roadrunner and burrowing owl are adept at finding food and shelter in the arid landscape. Reptiles, including the Gila monster and horned lizard, thrive in the heat by regulating their body temperature and seeking shade when needed. Amphibians like the desert rain frog and spadefoot toad emerge only when conditions are moist, and fish such as the desert pupfish inhabit isolated water sources. These adaptations enable a wide variety of species to survive and even flourish in one of Earth’s most challenging biomes.
        </p>
        <h1>Vegetation</h1>
        <p>
            Very few plants are able to thrive in the desert's harsh climate, but for some a hot, dry environment is ideal. The most iconic, the cactus and succulent, paint the landscape and define the region. Some wildflowers and grasses grow sparingly across the sands, and small trees and shrubs have adapted to survive in the dry climate by storing water in their roots and stems.
