        <h1>Climate</h1>
        <p>
            Grassland biomes are defined by their large open areas of grasses and flowers, and contain very few to no trees or shrubs. They can be found in almost every region including the Great Plains of North America, the Savannas of Southern Africa, and many parts of Australia. The grassland receives little precipitation, not hardly as dry as deserts, however, and average fluctuating temperatures.
        </p>
        <h1>Animal Life</h1>
        <p>
            Many animals make the grassland their home, including grazing animals like buffalo, zebra, and elephants, and some predatory animals like wolves, hyenas, and lions, which utilize the biome's tall grasses to remain unseen and stalk their prey.
