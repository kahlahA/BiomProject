        <h1>Climate</h1>
        <p>
            Jungles are typically found around the equator in tropical regions and characterized by its warm temperatures and high humidity and experience plentiful precipitation year-round. The largest of the jungle biomes is the Amazon Rainforest located in South America and is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. The dense canopy of tropical trees allows little sunlight to reach the forest floor, creating a unique environment for the species that inhabit it.

        <h1>Animal Life</h1>
        <p>
            The jungle biome contains the most diverse number of species, many of which are not found anywhere else in the world. These include mammals like monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees, birds like the toucan, parrot, and cassowary, and reptiles and amphibians like the anaconda, python and poison dart frog.
        </p>
        <h1>Vegetation</h1>
        <p>
            The vegetation in a jungle biome is extremely dense, with the jungle floor and the high tropical canopies being their own separate ecosystems. Massive jungle trees stretching as high as 250 feet (76 meters) cover the landscape, while a plethora of ferns and foliage grow from the nutrient rich soil of the jungle floor, despite the low sunlight of the canopies blocking most of it out.
